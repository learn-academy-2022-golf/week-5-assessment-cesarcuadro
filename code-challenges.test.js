// ASSESSMENT 5: JavaScript Coding Practical Questions with Jest

// Please read all questions thoroughly
// Pseudo coding is REQUIRED
// If you get stuck, please leave comments to help us understand your thought process

// Use test driven development to complete the following questions
// Add appropriate dependencies: $ yarn add jest

// Reminder: The test will call your function
// Run the file with the following command: $ yarn jest

// --------------------1) Create a function that takes in a string and returns a string with a coded message. The coded message converts "a" to 4, "e" to 3, "i" to 1, and "o" to 0.

// a) Create a test with expect statements using the variables provided.

Create a function that takes one parameter named string.

Select the character inside of the string.
Replace the character with an assigned number.
Return the encrypted string that has the same length as the original string.

I looked up if there was a way to replace a character with a number. 
My search led me to the built-in method .replaceAll()
.replaceAll() returns a string with all matches of a pattern that can be replaced by a replacement. 
The pattern being used is regex, or regular expressions, in order to find each instance of the argument and replaced with a number.
I am sure there is a way to make this code efficient, but I am unable to figure out a way to solve that issue.

// --------------------2) Create a function that takes in an array of words and a single letter and returns an array of all the words containing that particular letter.

// a) Create a test with expects statement using the variable provided.

Reading the documentation on the .filter() method, there is an example of how to use the method to find a string to uses the filter criteria and push it into a new array.
Using the .toLowerCase() method, I converted all of the strings inside of the array to lowercase in order to ensure that the search parameter will match the character regardless if it was originally uppercase or lowercase.
